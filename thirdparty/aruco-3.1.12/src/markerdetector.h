     * @brief The DetectionMode enum defines the different possibilities for detection.
     * Specifies the detection mode. We have preset three types of detection modes. These are
         * ways to configure the internal parameters for the most typical situations. The modes are:
         * - DM_NORMAL: In this mode, the full resolution image is employed for detection and slow threshold method. Use this method when
         * you process individual images that are not part of a video sequence and you are not interested in speed.
         *
         * - DM_FAST: In this mode, there are two main improvements. First, image is threshold using a faster method using a global threshold.
         * Also, the full resolution image is employed for detection, but, you could speed up detection even more by indicating a minimum size of the
         * markers you will accept. This is set by the variable minMarkerSize which shoud be in range [0,1]. When it is 0, means that you do not set
         * a limit in the size of the accepted markers. However, if you set 0.1, it means that markers smaller than 10% of the total image area, will not
         * be detected. Then, the detection can be accelated up to orders of magnitude compared to the normal mode.
         *
         * - DM_VIDEO_FAST: This is similar to DM_FAST, but specially adapted to video processing. In that case, we assume that the observed markers
         * when you call to detect() have a size similar to the ones observed in the previous frame. Then, the processing can be speeded up by employing smaller versions
         * of the image automatically calculated.
         *
